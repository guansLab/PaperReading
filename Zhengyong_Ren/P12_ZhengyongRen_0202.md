* Research Background:  
The video surveillance system has been widely deployed in many circumstances. 
* Problem to Solve:  
Storing privacy information in surveillance video.
* Key Design and Algorithm Proposed:  
A privacy-preserving surveillance video system where the privacy information
can be retrieved in a secure and reliable manner.
* Major Contribution:  
1, Proposes a detailed framework of storing privacy information in surveillance video.

2,  A perceptual-model-based compressed domain video watermarking scheme is proposed to deal with the huge
payload problem in the proposed surveillance system.

3, This system can monitor the unauthorized persons in a restricted environment, protect the privacy of the
authorized persons but, at the same time, allow the privacy information to be revealed in a secure and reliable way. 
* limited  
The bit-rate given the amount of privacy information and perceptual distortion requirement is also large.
* Something you don’t understand:  
Embedding Method A
* Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or negative):  
This is an effective information hiding method proposed to hide all the privacy information into the host video with
minimal perceptual distortion.
