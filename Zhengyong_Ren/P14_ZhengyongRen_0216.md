* Research Background:  
Concerning the protection of observed people’s privacy,smart video surveillance implies both risk and chance. The
systems’ increasing capabilities can be misused if we do not deploy suitable counter-measures. On the other hand, when
designed with care, such systems can be both privacy-aware and powerful. 
* Problem to Solve:  
A key mechanism of privacy-aware smart video surveillance is anonymization of video data.  
* Key Design and Algorithm Proposed:  
They employ a background estimator for learning the longterm background of the scene as well as for detecting
foreground objects, i.e., our regions of interest (RoI) for anonymization. 
* Major Contribution:  
1, Employ a background estimator for learning the longterm background of the scene as well as for detecting foreground objects.
2, Apply obfuscating image filters or pixel operations, and finally put the anonymized RoIs onto the long-term background model
of the scene.  
3,Investigates the effects of each anonymization technique.
* Something you don’t understand:  
Measuring Utility and Privacy
* Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or negative):  
Acceptable privacy protection can be achieved with most of the anonymization techniques evaluated. Combinations of the techniques may further improve privacy protection without reducing the utility of video data.
