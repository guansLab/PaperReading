* Research Background:  
Computer simulations are growing in sophistication and producing results of ever greater fidelity. This trend has been
enabled by advances in numerical methods and increasing
computing power. Yet these advances come with several
costs including massive increases in data size, difficulties examining output data, challenges in configuring simulation
runs, and difficulty debugging running codes.

* Problem to Solve:  
Interactive
visualization tools, like ParaView, have been used for postprocessing of simulation results. However, the increasing
data sizes, and limited storage and bandwidth make high
fidelity post-processing impractical.

* Key Design and Algorithm Proposed:  
Paraview Catalyst

* Major Contribution:  
ParaView Catalyst is a data
processing and visualization library that enables in situ analysis and visualization. In this paper, we presented the steps
involved in instrumenting a simulation code with Catalyst
support along with some of our successes.

* Major limitation
