## Paper Review:
* Research Background:
VTK and ParaView are leading software packages for data analysis
and visualization. Since their early years, Python has played an important role
in each package. In many use cases, VTK and ParaView serve as modules
used by Python applications. In other use cases, Python modules are used to
generate visualization components within VTK. 

* Problem to Solve:
Provide an overview of Python integration in VTK and ParaView and give some concrete
examples of usage. 

* Key Design and Algorithm Proposed:
1, Introduces basic VTK usage, describe the relationship between VTK and Python, and describe interfaces between the two
2, Ｄetailｓ the relationship between ParaView and Python.

* Conclusions
Python has been integrated into VTK and ParaView for many years. The integration continues to mature and expand as Python
is used in an increasing number of ways in both software packages. As Python continues to grow in popularity among the
scientific community, so too does the need for providing easyto-use Pythonic interfaces to scientific visualization tools. As
demonstrated in this paper, VTK and ParaView are well-positioned to continue adapting to the future needs of scientific Python
programmers.

* Major limitation:
VTK and ParaView currently just support Python 2.6 and 2.7, so support for Python 3 is targeted for sometime in 2016.

* Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or negative)
This is a good paper to quickly know the relationship along python, VTK and Paraview.
