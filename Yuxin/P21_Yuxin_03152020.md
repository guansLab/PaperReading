### Paper Review
- Research Background

  Neural architecture search has received a lot of attention for building novel architectures and reach better results. Most neural architecture search methods are either using evolutionary algorithm or reinforcement learning, and both techniques can produce architectures outperforming architectures designed by human.

- Problem to Solve

  Even though the results of previous neural architecture search are pretty good, those methods have to consume huge amount of time computation resources.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

  1. Within the search space, find a cell structure which is built with multiple different convolutional operators first, and then build the CNN with multiple found cells.
  2. Train a predictor to evaluate the possible performance of searched architectures.
  3. Start from simplest models, train those simplest models and expand them to more complex models, and then select K best models which are evaluated by the preditor.

- Major Contribution

  1. Their method can achieve similar results as previous state-of-the-art methods with fewer sampled models.
  2. With their predictor and their progressive method, the computation cost is much lower.

- Major limitation

  They only discover their method in CNN, leaving many other domains unexplored. So it is hard to say whether their method can produce good results on other domains.

- Something you don’t understand

  I don't quite understand how their predictor works. 

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

  1. Exploring methods to save computation cost and time consuming on neural architecture search is very promising.
  2. The datasets they use is very common image classification datasets which are fully explored.
  3. Starting from simple models and using a predictor to evaluate the performance without training is very novel method.
