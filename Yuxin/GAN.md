### Title: Generative Adversarial Networks

### Publication: NIPS

### Author: Ian Goodfellow et al.

### Paper Review
- Research Background

Although there are many generative models existing, those models cannot learn enough probabilistic distributions from data, thus they cannot produce convincing fake data. 

- Problem to Solve



- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

1. Adding an adversarial network, discriminator, to estimate the data generated from the generative network. 
2. Discriminator and Generator play a minimax game 

- Major Contribution



- Major Limitation
