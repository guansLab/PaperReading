### Paper Review
- Research Background

Traditional generative models like VAEs and GANs have achieved great performance in generating data close to original data, but these approaches may face some problems.

- Problem to Solve

There are many problems during training of traditional GAN like mode collapse and unstability, these problems can prevent GANs from converging to the global optimum.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

1. Use Earth Mover distance as the cost function.
2. Propose an alternative generative algorithm WGAN.

- Major Contribution

1. They improve the stability of learning procedure.
2. Their optimization method is sound.
3. Their method avoids mode collapse which is a problem that happens in GAN, meaning the generator collapses and produces limited variety of samples.

- Major limitation

They don't provide a way to evaluate generated images using their method and other's methods.

- Something you don’t understand

I don't know how supremum performs.

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

1. I think proposing alternative algorithms to GAN is very promising because traditional GAN has many problems during training.
2. I think using different lost functions to help learning is a good method.
3. They use LSUN dataset which is a common image dataset.

- The image which is important
