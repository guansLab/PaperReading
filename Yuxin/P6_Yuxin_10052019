### Paper Review
- Research Background

  Data-driven approaches can lead to convincing results regarding inverse problems, but there are optimization problems because of non-explicit form of estimator.

- Problem to Solve

  Solve inverse problems in a non-linear representation space and thus provide a valid approach on image super-resolution problem.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

  1. Use a conditional model defined by a Gibbs energy form and consider the corresponding Gibbs distribution.
  2. Conditional model contains a discriminative model and a predictive model.
  3. Use CNN in the proposed conditional model.

- Major Contribution

  1. Propose a method to solve inverse problem.
  2. Propose an algorithm to fine-tune the generative model.
  3. Illustrate a valid approach on image super-resolution problem.

- Major limitation

  When using on very fine textures, their method can result in some unnatural textures.

- Something you don’t understand

  I don't know what is the warping field $\tau$.

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

  1. I think generating high-resolution images from low-resolution images is promising.
  2. I think their combination of Gibbs equation and GAN is innovative.
  3. They use a common dataset ImageNet to experiment their method and algorithm.
