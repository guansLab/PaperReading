### Paper Review
- Research Background

Generative adversarial networks are proposed to overcome difficulties of approximating probabilistic computations faced by previous traditional generative models.

- Problem to Solve

There is no control on generated data modes in unconditional generative models.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

Both the generator and discriminator are conditioned on extra information. This extra information can be any modality like data label. Adding an additional input layer to both the generator and discriminator to feed the extra information.

- Major Contribution

They add more information when training a GAN, leading to better generated results.

- Major limitation

There is no advanced models exploited in this paper, and the dataset used in this paper is rather simple.

- Something you don’t understand

I don't know what is Gaussian Parzen window log-likelihood estimate used to evaluate generated samples.

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

1. I think improving training of generative models is promising.
2. I think directly adding extra information to the model to help model train is a novel method.
3. I think the dataset they use in this paper, MNIST and YFCC100M, is some basic and simple datasets.
