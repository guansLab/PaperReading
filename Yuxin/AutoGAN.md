### Paper Review
- Research Background

Both NAS and GAN have been prevailing recently, but there is not attempt to combine NAS and GAN.

- Problem to Solve

Architecture design of GAN is relying on empirical knowledge without automation, and training procedure of GAN is highly sensitive to hyperparameters.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

1. Only use NAS to search generator's architecture.
2. Use RNN controller to control search procedure.

- Major Contribution

1. It is the first attempt to combine NAS and generative model together.
2. This automatic architecture search method performs better than handcrafted GAN.

- Major limitation



- Something you don’t understand
