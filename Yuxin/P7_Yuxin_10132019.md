### Paper Review
- Research Background

  GANs have demonstrated impressive performance for generating data.

- Problem to Solve

  Discriminator is considered as a classifier in regular GANs, but the sigmoid cross entropy loss function of this classifier can lead to gradient vanishing problem.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

  Use a-b coding scheme for discriminator, and modify the objective function of discriminator and generator.

- Major Contribution

  1. They proposed a method to prevent gradient vanishing from happening.
  2. They use their method to generate data using different datasets and demonstrate their method is effective with evaluation.

- Major limitation

  They don't use a convincing evaluate generated image using their method.

- Something you don’t understand

  I don't understand what is code scheme.

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

  1. I think solving the problem of gradient vanishing in area of GANs is very promise.
  2. Their datasets, LSUN, CIFAR-10, and HWDB are common image datasets, and they also use Chinese characters as their dataset which is very novel.
  3. I think their solution is very impressive.
