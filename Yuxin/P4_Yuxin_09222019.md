### Publication: CVPR

### Author：Ting-Chun Wang et al.


### Paper Review
- Research Background

  Existing algorithms to generate photo-realistic images are good at rendering those images, but those algorithms are time-consuming and expensive.

- Problem to Solve

  Produce high-resolution images using semantic label maps.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

  1. Use conditional GAN to generate high-resolution photo-realistic images.
  2. Use pix2pix as a baseline model for further building.
  3. Decompose the generator in order to output images with higher resolution.

- Major Contribution

  1. Their method doesn't need pre-trained models.
  2. Images generated by this method can surpass two state-of-the-art algorithms.
  3. This method can generate relatively high quality images in limited time.

- Major limitation

  They don't provide a method to evaluate images generated with editing appearance.

- Something you don’t understand

  I don't know what is semantic segmentation.

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

  1. I think generating high-resolution images is promising because
  2. They base their approach on pix2pix which is a good model to produce images.
  3. They use NYU dataset and ADE20K dataset which are not as famous as those datasets like ImageNet, Cifar, and MNIST.
