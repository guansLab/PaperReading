#### Problem to Solve
Academic profiles of scientist and organisations are engaging for both the scientific community and the general public. They help us understand individual productivity and reputation, the collective knowledge-making process, and aid decision-making. The practice of such understanding is an active area of research. One set of open questions is the elusive notion of influence, such as: How is a researcher or a research project influencing the world, what ideas did it built on, and who is being influenced? How does citation influence compare with influence and impact in other means, such as academic genealogy, mentorship, or social media activities?

#### Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

Xie et al.propose a new visual approach Influence Flower to observe the influence between each node entity and ego-center. Below are some component degign principle about the Influence Flower.

**Influence Flower** is laid out on a circle with the ego in the centre and alters evenly distributed along the arc. Xie et al.choose a circular design to make flower petals of the same length. Alternatives, such as placing alters in a horizontal line break the flower metaphor and could mislead due to the different edge lengths. Xie et al.decrease the angular span if the flower has less than 10 petals and linearly increase it if there are more than 25 petals. The maximum span is 270 degrees, for a maximum number of 50 petals. The alters with the highest maximum of incoming and outgoing influence are selected. Xie et al.sort the alters by the maximum of two influence instead of the sum to avoid cases when one colour overwhelms another. The default number of petals is 25. The selected petals are sorted by the influence ratio (blue to red colour) by default. The number and the ordering can be adjusted interactively. The scale of the flower is adjusted according to the display size and the number of petals.

**Edge** appearance is determined by the influence score. The colour and arrowhead of an edge indicate its direction. Xie et al.assign two contrasting colours, red to denote the influence that the ego has towards the alters and blue to represent the influence that the alters have towards the ego. The weight of the edge wi j denotes the strength of influence from entity ei to e j. wi j is proportional to the normalised influence score S¯i j  and log-normalised for visualisation. 

**Node** colour and size are determined by the pair of edges connected to the node. The colour of a node signifies the difference in strength between incoming and outgoing influence. Xie et al.define influence ratio as the difference between the incoming and outgoing influence, normalised by their sum. A blue (#053061) to red (#67001f) interpolator, d3-scale-chromatic, is used to determine node colour according to the influence ratio. The ego node is white. The size of a node is proportional to the sum of influence. Xie et al.scale the maximum node size according to the display size. The ego and the biggest alter have the maximum size, while the other nodes are scaled accordingly.

#### Major Contribution

• The Influence Flower, a new visual metaphor exposing the influence between a wide range of academic entities.
• The Influence Map system, available to the public, for curating and interacting with influence flowers in any scientific field.
• Extensive case studies demonstrating data-driven inquires for researchers, research projects, publication venues, organisations, and comparing academic influence to those in social media.

#### Future Work
Future work lies in two fronts. In this visual design, Xie et al.would like to ease the tension between its visualisation function and richness of the flower metaphor, such as to endow meanings to size and shade of the petals, and to enact growth. On the functional front, Xie et al.would like more versatile comparisons of flowers beyond subsets in time, and using the Influence Flower to understand the production and consumption of science at large.

#### Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)
(in Chinese)以下是我对这一篇paper读完之后的收获。这是我读到的第一篇具有创新性原理性的可视化设计性的文章，Dr.Xie和他的团队设计了一个可以具体描述个体和群体之间的影响的可视化图形的prototype(就像是bar chart，ThemeRiver一样)。每一个花瓣的边缘被分成了两半，第一半quantify的是incoming，第二半是outgoing，比如本文的研究对象：IEEE VAST有影响力的作者中，quantify influence using citations as the basic unit and consider the act of referencing another paper as a signal of incoming influence (to the ego). Similarly, being cited by another paper signals outgoing influence (from the ego)。他们在抛出原型之外还设计了一个Web based的influence flower可视化分析系统。系统的架构是前端用h5+d3js（这个influence flower也是调用d3js来实现的），后端的query engine是ElasticSearch。我查找了一下这个online engine，发现还挺有意思。该engine适合于一切数据量非常大的数据集并且可以提供快速的查找，使用Java写的，简单来说就是一个分布式后台分布式存储以及全文检索engine，挺适合我们实验室的研究背景。但是我发现了一个缺点，就是他们的dataset都是post-data，如果要求实现in situ模式的话不太方便使用，但是其他海量数据的场景都可以handle的。现在有很多大型互联网公司的后台检索架构都是用ES实现的，比如说：
1） 2013年初，GitHub抛弃了Solr，采取ElasticSearch 来做PB级的搜索。 “GitHub使用ElasticSearch搜索20TB的数据，包括13亿文件和1300亿行代码”。
2）维基百科：启动以elasticsearch为基础的核心搜索架构。 
3）SoundCloud：“SoundCloud使用ElasticSearch为1.8亿用户提供即时而精准的音乐搜索服务”。 
4）百度：百度目前广泛使用ElasticSearch作为文本数据分析，采集百度所有服务器上的各类指标数据及用户自定义数据，通过对各种数据进行多维分析展示，辅助定位分析实例异常或业务层面异常。目前覆盖百度内部20多个业务线（包括casio、云分析、网盟、预测、文库、直达号、钱包、风控等），单集群最大100台机器，200个ES节点，每天导入30TB+数据。
说明ES有替换传统DB的潜力，我觉得可以在redesign JobPlot工作的时候，以此为契机，将ES练练手也是蛮好的。
抛开架构方面的话题，我觉得一个优秀的工作，其设计出来的系统一定是非常重要的。其中包括了：优美的interface，优质的交互性，快速和用户query response，这些都是必须的。所以以后的工作重心需要从琢磨前端转向后台的设计和优化，争取录制出好看的Supporting vedio来。
另外，我在paper reading note文件夹里准备了一个summary，以后专门用来记录paper中的一些词伙、搭配还有一些值得注意的地方，比如写作习惯、系统架构等等。
