**Publication: IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems ( Volume:
13 , Issue: 3 , Mar 2002 )**

IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS) is published
monthly. It publishes a range of papers, comments on previously published
papers, and survey articles that deal with the parallel and distributed systems
research areas of current importance to our readers.

The articles in this journal are peer reviewed in accordance with the
requirements set forth in the IEEE PSPB Operations Manual (sections 8.2.1.C &
8.2.2.A). Each published article was reviewed by a minimum of two independent
reviewers using a single-blind peer review process, where the identities of the
reviewers are not known to the authors, but the reviewers know the identities of
the authors. Articles will be screened for plagiarism before acceptance.

-   Research Background

    -   Focused on optimizing scheduling task by performing combination of
        upward and downward search on DAG

-   Problem to Solve

    -   Assigning task to machine from DAG on heterogenous system is not only
        requires the resources also it depends on communication channel and
        speed.

-   Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

    -   HEFT

        -   Heterogeneous Earliest- Finish-Time

        -   Read nodes in DAG from downward order from finishing task to start

        -   Calculate the mean

        -   Assign tasks to machine based on maximum rank and average
            computation cost

        -   Randomly assign task with similar rank

    -   CPOP

        -   The critical path on a processor

        -   Runs the same HEFT algorithm then adds the downward computation cost
            to the result

        -   Tries to eliminate the extra cost between PEs communication

    -   SLR

        -   Schedule Length ratio

        -   By minimizing the cost and choosing the highest rank it tries to
            speedup the scheduling

-   Major Contribution

    -   Considering the communication cost and taking the average of upward and
        downward would be helpful however the method is deprecated and with
        higher bandwidth between cloud systems method only works if the workflow
        is I/O intensive

-   Major limitation

    -   Needs to have a complete set of tasks and workflows before running the
        algorithm

        -   More than 1M nodes can introduce overhead

        -   Computation intensive

        -   In worst case scenario performs similar to other algorithms

-   Something you don’t understand

    -   They assumed that DAG are generated by previous algorithm however
        different characteristic can introduce more complications

-   Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or
    negative)

    -   Useful to understand the limitation of DAG and basic algorithms however
        not applicable to large scale cloud infrastructure by todays standard
