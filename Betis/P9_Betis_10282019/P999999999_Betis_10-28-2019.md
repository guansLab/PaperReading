-   Research Background

    -   Designing a multi task parallel reinforcement learning in order to make
        it possible to scale for different scenarios

-   Problem to Solve

    -   The other DRL (deep reinforcement learning) is more specific and not
        applicable to general problems due to the dimensionality and decision
        making however in this paper authors tried to solve this issue

-   Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

>   In this system each child process corresponds to specific agent and each
>   agent can have different reward function base on calculated value

>   State space is a specific situation of task waiting to be assigned on
>   cluster

>   Action space is set of events taking on arrival tasks

>   Reward function is based on minimizing the average job execution

>   Similar to other papers from reinforcement learning authors calculate the
>   softmax of entire execution time

>   At the end the algorithm performs asynchronous update on shared counters

-   Major Contribution

    -   Evaluation against least connection scheduling (LC) and particle swarm
        optimization (PSO) shows improvement by 15 to 39 percent

-   Major limitation

    -   Comparison was done against basic scheduling algorithm not to recent one

    -   The method is the same as recent work on reinforcement learning by
        adding critic section over result

-   Something you donâ€™t understand

    -   Test platform was done on small scale and the entire algorithm is not
        yet be tested in large scale!

-   Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or
    negative)

    -   The approach seems like the recent with a update on the result part
        however the entire algorithm needs to be tested on larger scale system
