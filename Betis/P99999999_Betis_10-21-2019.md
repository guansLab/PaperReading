-   Research Background

    -   Progress based dynamic scheduler for Pods and Kubernetes management
        system

-   Problem to Solve

    -   Current schedulers is based on balancing and heuristic data however
        using prediction the authors tool can be used to schedule dynamically
        and end up with a better performance on entire system

-   Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

    -   Two types of container in cloud system:

        -   Short-lived container which is usually computation container and
            after the process is done, they will expire

        -   Long-lived containers which is services we use to communicate such
            as networking and storage and logging

    -   Time cost depends on three factors:

        -   Job itself, the executed task inside container

        -   Resource availability, can vary depend on target system

        -   Workload on workers, containers on same worker compete for resources

    -   Kubernetes has 6 different features:

        -   API server

        -   Controller manager

        -   Scheduler

        -   Kuberlet

        -   Service Proxy

        -   Etcd

    -   The author design was to log the worker in manager node and analyze
        those logs to predict the next finishing job in order to maximizing the
        scheduling algorithm

    -   Each log can generate a score based on remaining jobs and future
        available resources

    -   In their design application report the status periodically

    -   The system choose where to place container based on latest report minus
        the n-1 report

    -   The resources consumption is being calculated by the summation of
        overall resource consumption for each worker and getting the finishing
        time score based on reports

-   Major Contribution

    -   Using their system the improvement overall is 23.0%

    -   The completion time can be scaled up to 53.3% improvement

    -   Makespan can be improved up to 37.4%

-   Major limitation

    -   Needs system level implementation in Kubernetes in order to get the logs
        and override the current scheduler

    -   The decision making is based on maximizing the score however, if the
        worker goes down there is no counter measure and system does not
        calculate the overall possible outcomes

-   Something you donâ€™t understand

    -   Makespan can sometimes be higher execution (according to their chart)
        but the method they are using should give you a better result

-   Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution (positive or
    negative)

    -   Depends on the actual system if we want to implement this method we need
        to see if we can have in progress logs from container or slurm in our
        design if so, it would be a helpful decision maker for actual scheduler
