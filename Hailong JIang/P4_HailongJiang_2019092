Title: Tracking a Value’s Influence on Later Computation

Publication: 

Author：Philip C. Roth

Paper Review Research Background

Understanding how a program behaves is important for effective program development, debugging, and optimization, but obtaining the necessary level of understanding is usually a challenging problem.
One facet of this problem is to understand how a value (the content of a variable at a particular moment in time) influences other values
as the program runs. 

Problem to Solve

To help developers understand value influence for their programs

Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

A novle tool that allows a user to tag a value as being of interest, and then track the influence of that value as it, or values that were derived from it, are used in later computation,
communication, and I/O

Major Contribution

A novel tool VIT

Major limitation

Not really accurate in all situations. The influence is not exactly examined.
