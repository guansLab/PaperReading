### Paper Review
- Research Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder. Research has exploredpotential ASD subgroups with preliminary evidence supporting the existence of behaviorally and genetically distinct subgroups; however, research has yet to leverage machine learning to identify phenotypes on a scalelarge enough to robustly examine treatment response across such subgroups. The purpose of the present studywas to apply Gaussian Mixture Models and Hierarchical Clustering to identify behavioral phenotypes of ASD andexamine treatment response across the learned phenotypes.


- Problem to Solve

Subtypes of ASD may contribute to the variation in treatment re-sponse observed among individuals with ASD. As such, assessmentsable to classify subgroups of ASD will aid the development of targetedtreatment [64]. Similar to the targeted treatments of subtypes of cancer,for instance leukemia [65] and breast cancer [66], targeted treatmentsof subtypes of ASD may improve outcomes.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed

The present study included a sample of children with ASD (N= 2400), the largest of its kind to date. Unsupervised machine learning was applied to model ASD subgroups as well as their taxonomicrelationships. Retrospective treatment data were available for a portion of the sample (n= 1034). Treatment response was examined within each subgroup via regression. The application of a Gaussian Mixture Model revealed 16 subgroups. Further examination of the sub-groups through Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering suggested 2 overlying behavioral phenotypes with unique deficit profiles each composed of subgroups that differed in severity of those deficits. Furthermore, differentiated response to treatment was found across subtypes, with a substantially higher amount of variance accounted fordue to the homogenization effect of the clustering

- Major Contribution

Low-level analysis of ASD behavioral phenotypes based on 8 dimensions of skills.
Use of unsupervised machine learning to detect behavioralprofiles,  and  relationship  between  them,  on  large (N = 2400) sample size.
Analysis of response to treatment across behavioral clusters.


  
- Major limitation

No data preprocessing was mentioned in this paper!

A limitation of the current study is the lack of data from standar-dized assessments. The use of standardized assessments could have enabled better comparison to previous cluster research as well as to other ABA outcome studies, and it could provide informationon the practical relevance of the skills that were mastered. 
  

- Something you don’t understand

  The part of how groups  responded  to  varying  treatment  intensity. 

- Your view on the research domain/topic/approach/data/solution  (positive or negative)

I think they needed to evaluate if group membership across behavioral subgroups is stable or if individuals may move between these groups (e.g., as they make progress in treatment) other than that the proposed work is very good.
