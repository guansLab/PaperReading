Kjerstin Thorson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Advertising, Public Relations and the School of Journalism. Her research explores the role of digital and social media in promoting—or hindering—political engagement.Recent research projects have investigated political uses of Facebook, the spread of climate change communication on social media, and the contributions of media use in shifting conceptions of politics among young adults.

Kelley Cotter is a PhD student in the Department of Media & Information. Her primary research area concerns how people become aware of and knowledgeable about algorithms applied in sociotechnical systems and resultant implications for the accumulation of different forms of capital. 

Mel Medeiros is a PhD student in the Department of Advertising and Public Relations. Her research interests include political communication, digital politics, social media, and the platformization of politics.

Chankyung Pak is an assistant professor in Division of Business and Management (DBM) at Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University (BNU-HKBU UIC). He is a computational social scientist who’s interested in the evolution of public discourse mediated by transforming media ecosystem.

### Paper Review
- Research Background
  1. The visibility of news and politics in a Facebook newsfeed depends on the actions of a diverse set of actors: users, their friends, content publishers such as news organizations, advertisers, and algorithms.
  2. We are not yet certain whether social newsfeeds increase serendipitous encounters with civic content – a happy outcome – or amplify individual preferences, leading to a rich-get-richer model of political content exposure.
  3. Users’ choices about what to ‘like’ or ‘follow,’ choices made by friends and followed organizations about what to post, and choices made by politicians and news organizations about whom to target with paid content. All of these selections are in turn mediated by algorithms that rank content for display in the newsfeed.

- Problem to Solve
  1. How does Facebook algorithmically infer what users are interested in, and how do interest inferences shape news exposure?
  2. How much power algorithms and the design of platforms have over the individual-level visibility of news and political content on social media.
  3. How users become algorithmically categorized as ‘interested’ in news and politics, and how that categorization is related to content exposure.

- Key Design and Algorithm Proposed
  1. Key Design
    - The focus of this paper is on untangling the role of this last actor from the others.
    - We weave together survey data and interest categorization data from participants’ Facebook accounts to audit the algorithmic interest classification system on Facebook.
